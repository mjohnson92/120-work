## *Experience*

*I thought OOP would have been hard to understand but I think for me it makes the process make more sense. Classes being blueprints, and objects being the prodcut of the blueprint is the best way to look at it. Lots of great videos this week to help you get the concept down too. The idea with an array is a bit more difficult but just need more practice with that.*

### *Process*

*I wanted to build something similar to the bubble sketch that Dan Schiffman made. I wanted to make it with shapes though that could change over time and color. Eventually it turned into squiggly lines but I still really like it. I did go back and forth with the shapes but it gets pretty slow. `random()` is starting to make even more sense to me this week. I have noticed that you can literally put it anywhere!*

### *Problems*

*I did work on trying to get the shapes to roate out from the center but when I tried to `translate()` the `rotate()` it translate the `mouseX, mouseY` as well so i pulled the rotate out. Not sure how that would be done or maybe it can't. Seems possible though.*

### *Future*

*Where will this take us next? Curious to see if you can do multiple classes in one sketch?*
