## *Experience*

*Functions are great! I'm excited to be using them, they can really condense your code. It makes sense to create things and define in this new way. I guess I should have seen it coming. I'll need to practice them more, I feel like my code can be even more condensed it would just take a lot of thinking and problem solving. The ability to condense makes me think about technology itself, it's journey of exponential growth. I feel it's similar to learning coding. Like once you overcome one step, you just copy and paste what you've learned and move on quickly.*

### *Process*

*I decided to revisit week 8, something I've already revisited but I feel it's my most advanced code so I wanted to see how I could bring functions into the mix. It proved to be very helpful in this one. I ended up only having to create 4 but running 12 instances of each to create plenty of quads, ellipses, and curves. Very happy with the result in this one. My ideas kinda came to life for once.*

### *Problems*

*The biggest problem I ran into was trying to understand where I could fit the array in. I understood what the array was, but realized it couldn't be used when running my functions. I needed to be used in the definition of my function. I tried to first place parameters in the `shape(windowWidth*.5, windowHeight*.5, -50);`. I wanted to put a variable in one of the 3 parameters for shape. Never really understood why it wouldn't work except that it's probably because of how the function is written with these three variables. Like you can't throw an array in a variable paramter of the function when trying to print it. Something like that.*

### *Future*

*Feelin better, looking forward to learning new material next week!*
