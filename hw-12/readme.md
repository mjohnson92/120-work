## *Experience*

*This last assignment went well after I realized my limits! I did however try my best to problem solve my issues until my head began to hurt. I started off
with an idea of making a ball maze. Where I struggled there was making the ball recognized the man made walls. I'm sure it's not that difficult but I tried several different ideas and could not complete it. So i decided to create something else and it's pretty cool.*

### *Process*

*To start I began with the balls that recognize each other, the walls, and change color when they hit something. I immediately wanted to get away from that idea so I started to mess with the shape of the ball. Then I create something that looked like a firefly to me so I went with that idea. Fireflys in a field at night. But I wanted it to be able to do something else than exactly what the ball scenario did. So I decided to make it so the fireflys can leave the screen when they change color after running into each other. Thought that was a pretty cool touch, like they are angry or one fell to the ground and died. After that I did a lot of problem solving when making new classes. I understand the process a lot more than when I began the assignment. Some things like the grass I decided to put in a class afterwords. I think that was part of the assignment though, to go full OOP.*

### *Problems*

*The biggest problems I ran into were creating new classes and getting them to show on the screen. Mainly the stars because It was kind of a copy of the fireflies but I did not want them to move but to start in a random location every time you refresh. So that took some time but it was completed through eliminating a lot of things from the old class one by one. The grass was a similar situation but it was fun trying to get it to work and make it look windy.*

### *Future*

*Thanks for everything! It's been a fun semester, there were plenty of headaches but I after it's all said and done, I really enjoyed the expereince learning P5!!*
