## *Experiences*

*During this homework session I followed along this week's course content. I found the video and the text directions and examples very helpful. I learned how to create an epllipse, add text, and add background color in p5.js.*

### *Process*

*I took a few steps to complete this assignment. Most importantly, made time to watch the videos and mess with the p5 blocks in the actual 120 website. I'm surprised at the ease up on difficulty so far. Most of what we are doing makes sense to me.*

### *Problems*

*The only problem I ran into was trying to figure out if I just needed to open index.html from my directory to see the results of the sketch.js file. Of course all I had to do to solve that question was open index.hmtl. It opened my browser and there it was.*

### *Future*

*I'm excited to advance further and to see the next steps in p5.*
