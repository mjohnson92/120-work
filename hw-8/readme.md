## *Experience*

*Since we were given such an open assignment, I wanted to revisit animation a little bit and use what I've learned in the last few weeks to try to update an idea. I am pretty happy with the result and I felt comfortable once I got going. I almost feel like the for loop made everything come together in understanding a lot of the previous weeks. I'm not sure why but it I feel great this week.*

### *Process*

*I decided to start from scratch and I mean, literal from line 1. I did however copy over some of my code from the week 4 just to see how a small piece worked. Once I figured it out I started over again and recreated the same start from that week. Then I took it in to a newer place using ``if`` statements, ``let``,``for``,``mouseButton``, and even ``KeyIsPressed``! I really went diving into the reference this week to create something from scratch. I wanted to fulfil what I had in my head while I was creating the piece. I would have an idea and see if I could come up with the code to create it. Sometimes it took a while but I eventually would get what I wanted. I am curious to know if I could some how for loop all the quads I created but that seems like it wouldn't be possible with what I created.*

### *Problems*

*The biggest problem I ran into was trying to get a for loop to work with what I had in my head. Although I found one solution, ``mouseButton``, it seems to be the most boring use for a for loop. I wanted to make it so the animation and for loop only ran when the mouse was pressed down. But I feel like I would have to change my entire code and a lot of things for that to work, so I became satisfied with the button and created unique if statements.*

### *Future*

*Feelin better, looking forward to learning new material next week!*
