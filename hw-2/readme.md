    What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

*This week was a great refresher. Last weekend I did nearly the exact same assignment for the Media Arts **'Intro to Web Design'** class. I feel comfortable using the following programs:*

1. Atom
2. Github Desktop
3. Github.com

*Something that I still do not feel very comfortable with is the **Terminal** on the Mac. I followed along with the videos though so I did recieve some experience. I need to go back to week 1 and read the magic terminal story some more.*

*I feel as though the course is set up very well. It's easiest to just follow along page by page. There's no good reason to skip around in the lessons.*
