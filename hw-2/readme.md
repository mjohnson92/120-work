    What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

*This week was a great refresher. Last weekend I did nearly the exact same assignment for the Media Arts **'Intro to Web Design'** class. We created accounts on Github, created readmes' and even our first HTML website. Already, I feel quite a bit comfortable using the following items:*

1. Atom
2. Github Desktop
3. Github.com

*Committing, pushing, and fetching has come easily now that I've done it so many times.*

*Something that I still do not feel very comfortable with is the **``Terminal``** on the Mac.*

- ``$ cd``

- ``$ cd Documents``

- ``$ mkdir 120-work``

- ``$ cd 120-work``

*I'm starting to understand how to change directories, make folders, and open things. Using the terminal in combination with github was very interesting, that will take a lot of work to get comfortable with. I followed along with the videos though so I did recieve some experience. I need to go back to week 1 and read the magic terminal story some more. This was mainly the only issue I ran into and I solved it by following along in the tutorial videos. I did not end up posting anything in the class repo issue tracker.*

*I feel as though the course is set up very well. It's easiest to just follow along page by page. There's no good reason to skip around in the lessons. I feel like my favorite part so far is using the Markup Language. Doing these journal-like readme's is really going to be useful to become a pro at using the language.*
