## *Experience*

*This homework assignment was quite intimidating to begin with but as I worked my way through making all different sorts of shapes and messing with their characteristics, everything sort of fell into place. The best way to learn this stuff is to jump right in through copy and pasting at first, then messing with parameters and seeing how it effects the index.html. By the time I decided I was finished with my assignment I had put a few hours into it and lost track of time. I actually really enjoyed the experience cause it feels like it tests your ability to problem solve.*

### *Process*

*My process behind creating my hw-4 was pretty much constant problem solving. Which I think was great for learning the material. At first I was overwhelmed with the things I did not understand right away but after a few hours in I solved a lot of the issues that I was having trouble with. The best resource in this is yourself once you have what you want. Copy and pasting your own code makes things a lot easier. It makes sense to reuse code if the shape youve created prior will be similar or close to the next.*

### *Problems*

*The biggest problem I had with the code was realizing how origin and translate work and that they also will work together when in the same code. I was confused by the parameters of translate because I had forgotten where my origin was. It was also helpful to rediscover that the origin is originally at the top left corner at the screen. Of course in this assignment our origin is ment to be in the middle so negative parameters started to make a whole lot more sense. I just had to remember my coordinate plane stuff from math. I often felt like I was counter-productive due to how my translations were just these random numbers but I feel like leaving them showed me exactly what it was doing. Using translate and the coordinate system within lets say an ellipse, (x,y,w,h) just feels odd and like I said counterproductive but it helped me solve and realize exactly what I was doing.*

*This makes it look quite backwards too but it would be a mess to go back and fix it. Like I said it helped me realize how these parameters work so I can move forward from here and have cleaner code.*

### *Future*

*After this assignment I feel a lot ore comfortable with the basic layout and creation of shapes in p5.*
