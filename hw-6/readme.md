## *Experience*

*This is definitely the toughest assignment yet! I think it's because there are so many attributes now and the fact that you can make unlimited variables and can kind of get lost in it. Well, I'm doing my best to try and keep up. I prefer not to just copy and paste and make a few changes to the example code, that isn't going to help me in the long run. I spent quite a long time on my assignment but I feel as though it is quite simple. I would have loved to figure out how to move my shapes but leave the shapes behind like it's constantly updating my page. Just like the smiley face example, you can tell there's hundreds behind it.*

### *Process*

*Problem solving over and over again. Putting in quite simple code at first and see what does what. It doesn't take long for you to see what changes your making. The hard part is adding more code and making it fit in somehow to your previous code without having to reshape everything. I't going to be hard to remember all these processes, I am still trying to keep up with the ones we used on our self portrait. I guess I need to put more time into it.*

### *Problems*

*My biggest problem was getting started really. I kept testing code to see what it would do and then I had to try to decide where I would go next. If I had more time I would have posted in the forum about my problem from the first paragraph. I think that would have made a pretty cool touch to what I made. Right now it kind of seems basic but I tried to include all the required things from the homework.*

### *Future*

*The future is scary.*
